cin >> input, acts as getline for char[n], perhaps an oversimplification...

limitations are: cin cannot directly accept int, use atoi

Features: keyboard interrupts, iostream, AHCI sata, DMA, FAT32 filesystem, format, chkdsk, game engine, copy and paste, delete and touch commands. 

TODO: examine chkdsk upon mutiOS file writes, for spurious deletion.
Dump DMA and PCIE to file...
